			<h1>Growth decisions</h1>
			<hr>
			<h2>Type of beans</h2>
			<p>This wasn't really a decision, but the beans that were grown were pinto beans.</p>

			<h2>Type of container</h2>
			<p>Shree Rajesh Rajaram was grown in a clay pot with a diameter of about 21.5 cm. and a height of about 18.5 cm., while Jilly Bean was grown is a re-purposed plastic yogurt container with a diameter of about 11.5 cm. and a height of about 14.5 cm. As for the clay pot, there was a relatively large hole at the bottom for excess water, while holes were made on the side and bottom of the plastic pot.</p>
			<p>As for why, there wasn't really that much thought behind it. The clay pot was obtained as the original pot was way too small, so the larger clay pot would provide more room. The plastic pot was used so the soil and roots could be viewed, as well as the moisture of the soil.</p>

			<h2>Soil</h2>
			<p>The soil used was Expert Gardener potting soil. As this was the first time planting plants and purchasing soil, there were too many options, so I went for the one that seemed like the simpliest option available, as long as it had the nessecary substances that would allow the plant to grow.</p>

			<h2>Fertilizer/Nutrition</h2>
			<p>There was no fertilizer used as I thought it was unessecary. This may have been a fatal mistake, but I did not think that I needed it at the time.</p>

			<h2>Location</h2>
			<p>I chose a rack next to my window, so the plants could experience natural sunlight during the day, and artificial sunlight for some time during the night.</p>

			<h2>Stake choice</h2>
			<p>I was trying to be resourceful and use materials that were already available to me. I went with a wooden rod from a small flag and legos.</p>

			<h2>Amount of sunlight</h2>
			<p>I tried to give the plants as much light as possible. They would have had 24 hours of light if I didn't have to turn the lights off, but it is fine since plants in the wild do not have an artificial light during the night.</p>

			<h2>Amount of water</h2>
			<p>In 7th grade science, we grew some small plants, and we only needed a full pipet of water every day. I tried scaling this with some knowledge from scrapbooks done by previous students in the past, and went for about 1/4 cups a day, and increasing or decreasing the amount based on how the soil looked. At first I used a steel cup to give the water, but then switched to a bowl and used my hands to sprinkle the water evenly amongst the soil.</p>

			<h1>Tropisms</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>A tropism is how a plant is reacting to external stimuli.</p>

			<h2>Phototropism</h2>
			<p style="margin-bottom:4px">Phototropism is a plant's reaction to sunlight by moving towards the source of the light</p>

			<h2>Thigmatropism</h2>
			<p>Thigmatropism is a plant's response to touch or a solid object, in which it will curl around</p>

			<h2>Geotropism</h2>
			<p>Geotropism is when a plant will always grow with the roots down and the stem up, thanks to gravity</p>
