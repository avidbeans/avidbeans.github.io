				<h1>What is the relationship between photosynthesis and cellular respiration?</h1>
				<p>On a basic level, photosynthesis provides the glucose that is needed for cellular respiration to function. Photosynthesis takes carbon dioxide and water, and under sunlight, produces glucose and oxygen. Photosynthesis has both light-dependent reaction and light-independent reactions. In the light dependent reaction, a photon hits the chlorophyll and photosystem II is activated. This electron is pumped through to the cytochrome complex and photosystem I with an electron stolen from water. All the energy in Photosystem I is used to make NADPH. Then there is the light-independent or calvin cycle. Carbon is fixed to ribulose biphosphate, which makes it unstable, and the first stable products will finally be created when the RuBP becomes 2 molecules of 3-Phosphoglycerate. Then, these get a phosphate from ATP, and become glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Five G3Ps are used to regenerate 3 RuBPs, which all came from 9 ATP and 6 NADPH. 3 RuBPs are converted into 6 G3Ps, but only one is able to leave the cycle. The G3P becomes glucose. Cellular respiration is how the cell gets energy, or ATP. Cellular respiration starts in the cytoplasm, where glycolysis is performed. Glycolysis takes 2 ATP and produces 4 ATP, as well as two pyruvic acids. Then if there is oxygen, the mitochondria will undergo the krebs cycle and turn each pyruvic acid into 1 ATP, 3 NADH, 1 FADH(sub)2, and CO(sub)2. Finally, the energy carrier molecules enter the electron transport chain, which produces about 34 ATP, although this number is not always to same. The products of photosynthesis are the reactants of cellular respiration.</p>

				<h1>Define the 3 plant systems: Reproductive, transport/vascular, and response.</h1>
				<p>The first plant system is the reproductive. Plants have both male and female reproductive parts. The male part is called the stamen and the female part is called the pistil. The stamen includesthe anther, which contains the pollen, and filaments, which hold the anthers. The pistil includes the stigma, which is where the pollen is placed, the style, which is a tube on top of the ovary, the ovary, which is the reproductive organ, and the ovule, which is what will become the seed when fertilized with pollen. The vascular system includes two main tissues, which are the xylem and phloem. The xylem transport water and dissolved minerals to the leaves, and the phloem transports food from the leaves to the rest of the plant. The plant response system does not consist of any organs, but it is how the plant responds to external stimulus, such as leaning towards the sun. An example of all these systems working together is the response system making the roots go deeper for more nutrients in the soil, which the vascular system takes to the leaves for photosynthesis, which is used for the plant to grow, and will attract more pollinators for pollination, which is the reproductive system.</p>

			<div class="question" style="grid-column: 5">
				<h1>Why do plants need to exchange gases with the environment?</h1>
				<p>A plant needs two main gases for photosynthesis and cellular respiration, carbon dioxide and oxygen. Because of the need for these gases, the plant will have to exchange with the environment to obtain the gases as needed.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question" style="grid-column: 5">
				<h1>Identify the main gas exchange organs in plants? Explain how this process take place.</h1>
				<p>The main organs for exchanging gas in the plant include the cuticle and pores of the epidermis on the plant leaf. The gas exchange happens because of diffusion.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question" style="grid-column: 1 / 4">
				<h1>Define plant transpiration. What are the two main types of plant transpiration processes? Which of them has a greater volume?</h1>
				<p>Transpiration is when the plant gives off water vapor into the atmosphere, therfore a loss of water. There is cuticular transpiration and stomatal transpiration. Cuticular transpiration occurs in the cuticle, and stomatal transpiration occurs through the ostioles of the stomata. Stomatal transpiration is more important because it is regulated more.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question" style="grid-column: 4 / 6">
				<h1>Define stomata? How do these structures participate in plant transpiration?</h1>
				<p>Stomata are openings for water and gases to enter and leave and are found in the epidermis of plants. When plants need to lose water, the stomata open, and it closes when the plant doesn't want to lose water.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question" style="grid-column: 1 / 3">
				<h1>Identify and draw the elements that compose stomata.</h1>

			</div>
			<div class="question" style="grid-column: 3 / 6">
				<h1>Explain how do plants control the opening and the closing of stomata?</h1>
				<p>Stomata are made out of a central opening, which is called the ostiole or slit, and is surrounded by the guard cells. The guard cells are the cells that are opening and closing the stomata.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question" style="grid-column: 1 / 4">
				<h1>Is transpiration the only way through which leaves lose water? Elaborate. What is transpiration?</h1>
				<p>Other than transpiration, plants can also lose water (as a liquid) through guttaion. Guttation occurs in in hydathodes, which are like stomata. Guttation will take place when transpiration is not the ideal option and this could be because of a high air humidity or soil with a lot of water. Transpiration is when a plant loses water as water vapor.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question" style="grid-column: 4 / 6">
				<h1>How do the volume of water absorption and the volume of water transpiration vary in plants over the course of a day? Overall, how can they be compared?</h1>
				<p>During the day, there is more water that is being lossed to transpiration than the amount of water taken in by the roots. At night, it is the opposite and the amount of water that the roots take in is more than the amount of water they lose to transpiration. Overall in a full day, they cancel out and lose about the same amount of water that was absorbed.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question" style="grid-column: 1 / 3">
				<h1>How do plants solve the problem of transporting substances throughout their tissues?</h1>
				<p>Non-vascular plants use diffusion, whlie vascular plants have xylem which is used to carry mainly water, and phloem, which is used to carr mainly food.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question" style="grid-column: 3 / 6">
				<h1>Are xylem and phloem made of living cells? Explain.</h1>
				<p>Xylem cells are dead cells, because of a process of the cell wall known as lignin deposition. Phloem, on the other hand, are living cells.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question"style="grid-column: 1 / 4">
				<h1>What is root pressure?</h1>
				<p>Root pressure is what causes the xylem in the roots to absorb the water from the soil. This is because of the gradient of water between the inside of the root and the soil.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question" style="grid-column: 4 / 6">
				<h1>What is capillarity? How is this phenomenon chemically explained? What is the relevance of capillarity for water transport in plants?</h1>
				<p>Capillarity is where water moves inside thin tubes (capillaries), due to a thin wall and the water molecules. One of the properties of water's hydrogen bonds is capillarity, which is where water moves up in a thin tube due to adhesion between the wall and the water, and cohesion between the water molecules themselves. It is not really that important in plants because the water only increases (height-wise) by a few centimeters.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question" style="grid-column: 1 / 3">
				<h1>What are plant hormones? Give examples.</h1>
				<p>Plant hormones are also called phytohormones, and control embryonic development and growth in plants. Five major plant hormones include gibberellines, cytokinins, ethylene, abscisic acid, and auxin.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question" style="grid-column: 3 / 6">
				<h1>What is the coleoptile? Why does the removal of the extremity of the coleoptile prohibit plant growth?</h1>
				<p>Tbe coleoptile is the aerial structure of a sprouting plant which emerges from the seed. It wraps around the first leaves and the stem to protect them. The extremity of the coleoptile is where the auxins are produced. Auxins are nessecary for growth and tissue differentiation, so growth will stop if the top is removed.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question" style="grid-column: 1 / 4">
				<h1>How are plant tissues classified according to their functions?</h1>
				<p>Plant tissues are divided into embryonic tissues, supporting tisues, filling/photosynthetic tissues, vascular tissues, and dermal tissues</p>
			</div>
			<div class="question" style="grid-column: 4 / 6">
				<h1>What is the vascular cambium? What is its function?</h1>
				<p>The vascular cambium is a meristematic tissue that forms the vascular tissues. Usually, the outer side creates phloem layers and the inner sides creates xylem layers.</p>
